# Bitcoin-Predictions
•	Analyzed blockchain digital tradability by comparing cryptocurrencies with Euro, Gold, Oil, S&P500 </br>

•	Designed Bitcoin pricing model on time-series data, using ARIMA/VAR modelling in R and Python, with white correction test for heteroskedasticity to forecast stocks thereby improving the forecast accuracy by 13% </br>

•	Developing the same model in Python is not as easy as compared to R, since the time-series packages in python are inbuilt but requires more programming. </br>

•	Currently researching on developing the time-series package on python, to reduce the complexity for end users while working on time-series models to predict future demands.
